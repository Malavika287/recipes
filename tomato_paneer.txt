How to Make Tomato Paneer

1.In a pan add olive oil, zeera, star anise, ginger-garlic paste.
2.Add the diced capsicum. Saute for 1 minute. (You can saute it for longer in case you do not like your capsicum too crunchy.)
3.Add tomato puree. Add salt, garam masala and sugar. Cook till it leaves oil on the sides.
4.Add milk. Mix well. Add the paneer cubes. Let it cook for 2 minutes on low flame. Do not over cook the milk as it can curdle.
5.Garnish with coriander leaves and serve.
6.Note: Paneer cubes can be grilled on a non-stick tawa till light brown before adding to the base. You can also add a split green chilli to increase the heat of the dish in step number 3.
